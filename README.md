## Post mortem

### Overview
Loved the exercise, good in difficulty and similarity with the current workflow. Hope you guys like it :)

### To be improved
- CSS structure is a bit defficient. There are still some refactors to be done on the way CSS is Structure. Ran out of time because I focused on functionality first.
- UI structure. Recreated Table structure with divs (because nested table, but I see now I could just use nested tables)
- Modal still needs more info to be added, should have asked from the beginning what info to add in the modal.
